# HomeAutomation

Home automation is used to turn on/off light using sensor. Also, it allows you to turn on/off light or sensor using command. It is basically a rest end point and people can directly use with desktop or mobile browser to do various action.

The project is written in scala programming language and a war will be generated which needs to deploy in tomcat (web server) in the raspberry pi to make it work.
